  <p>  Minefield </p>

<p class="justificado">The principles of Minefield: Each match begins with a board divided into several squares without any marking. After clicking on one of them, the squares around disappear, some will turn white, while others will have numbers. With the help of numbers, you can find out which ones have mines and which can be clicked. The Minefield works according to possible "answers", until only one remains viable.
</p>

<p class="justificado">Use the left and right mouse buttons. It takes nothing but the mouse to enjoy the game; With the left button, you click on squares without mines, while the right marks the squares "dangerous". In greater difficulties, use the right button to flag squares with mines until you can confirm. After clicking on a square, a good portion of the board will open and numbers will appear.
</p>

<p class="justificado">The meaning of the numbers. They refer to the number of mines that are "leaning" on that square. For example, if two squares are touching each other, and one of them has a "1," it is possible to infer that the other (without numbers) has a mine.
Select a difficulty level. In the upper left corner of the window, open the first game by clicking on one of the difficulty options:
	Easy 9x9: a 9x9 board with ten mines.
	Medium 16x16: 40 mines on a 16x16 board.
	Expert 30x16: the board will be 30x16 and will have 99 mines.
	Custom: You can set the game parameters by choosing the size of the board, mere number of mines, and so on.
Click on any square on the board for the game to begin.
</p>
<p class="justificado">See the numbers that appear. They indicate how many mines are touching the square with the number.
Right-click on any square you suspect is with mines. This will mark it; it is better to start with squares that are undoubtedly "explosive" (one that is alone next to a "1") to help in the elimination process later.
Do not mark more squares than the number of mines on the board.
</p>
<p class="justificado">Double-click the spaces where you are in doubt. A question mark will be placed in the square, indicating that you will not touch it until you discard others. This is a safe strategy on boards where it has already found almost all mines (when only two or three are missing).
<p class="justificado">Click on the mine-free squares to leave the spaces around "safely".
Clean the tray. To win a minefield round, you need to click on all squares on the board without any mine. As soon as i do, the game will be over. Accidentally selecting a square with a mine will cause the game to be finished. Choose "New Game" to start a new match, or "Play the same board" to try to win the same challenge.
</p>
<p class="justificado">Tips:
The more you play Minefield, the more easily you'll recognize patterns that indicate there's (or isn't) a mine. When you see a "121" pattern in a straight line, place a flag on the two "1" and click the "2".
